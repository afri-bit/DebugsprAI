We need to solve the issue based on following information. Ananlyse the file and check if there is any issue.
If the file is not empty, fix the code based on the following information:
* id: 1
* title: Python Hello World
* description: The add function is not working as expected
* type: bug
* src_folder: src
* test_folder: tests
* log: "2025-02-03 14:32:10 [INFO] The summary of number 4 and 5 is -1"

Requirements for the Output:
- No additional comment
- No markdown code annotations
- The output must contain only the code with the same structures as the input code, but with the necessary fixes. Empty code will be left empty as well.
- Comment the changes for fixed when necessary with AIFIX identification.
- Output must not contain any markdown annotations, so the code can be copied easily.
- If the file is empty, provide empty output as well. Just return empty string.
